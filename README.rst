Documentation

The full documentation is at https://django-coinpayments.readthedocs.io.

Quickstart
----------

Install django-coinpayments::

    pip install django-coinpayments

Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_coinpayments',
        ...
    )

Run ``migrate``::

    python manage.py migrate django_coinpayments


**Important!**

You have to provide API keys with `create_transaction`, `get_tx_info` permissions like this in your settings.py:

.. code-block:: python

    COINPAYMENTS_API_KEY = 'aaaaa'
    COINPAYMENTS_API_SECRET = 'aaa'

Have a look at the `example project <https://github.com/Bearle/django-coinpayments/blob/master/example/example/views.py>`_ to see usage examples.
As for now, the example project views cover creating new transactions, viewing payments and coinpayments transactions,
creating new payments using modelforms and creating new coinpayments transactions instead of the old one's (if the payment was filled partially)

Running Tests
-------------
